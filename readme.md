# {{ Dee Iannantuono }} - Portfolio Task

[My portfolio site]( https://dee-iannantuono.github.io/project_one/ )

## Project Requirements

### Content
On the main page of my website, I have included several different parts. In the About Me section, I have included a profile picture and a short biography. In the projects section, I have included 3 boxes as placeholders for future projects. There is a functional contact form on the second page of my website which i have used formspree to make functional. I have also included links to my linkedin, github and spotify at the bottom. 

### Technical
I have two web pages, one for the main page and another for the contact page. It is version controlled with Git and deployed on GitHub pages. It is responsive to mobile and desktop sizes and uses semantic HTML elements.

### Bonus (optional)
The only bonus thing i have added was a hover state for the submit text on the content form. I did this by following what we did for our SheCodes website in class. 

### Screenshots> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take ascreenshot that shows that.
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:#### {{ image_title }}
